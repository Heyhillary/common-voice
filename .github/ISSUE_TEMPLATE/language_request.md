# Welcome to the Common Voice Community !

> Common Voice aims to make speech technology accessible to everyone by building an open sourced dataset of labelled voice data that is representative of languages, variants and accents spoken across the world. This template helps us to know how your language could participate in the Common Voice Project. There are three sections of this form, once you have filled out a section please click the checkbox. If you have any issues please contact <commonvoice@mozilla.org>.

## Pontoon Set-up

> To start a language on Common Voice volunteers localise our platform [via Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/common-voice/) and create sentence corpusâ€™ of cc0 text. </p>

## Creating Language Community Channels

> By participating in this project, you're agreeing to uphold the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/). Establishing [communication platforms](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/blob/main/docs/COMMUNITIES.md) for your language can help to connect volunteers and mobilise people for community campaigns. Officially the Common Voice Community Platforms are [discourse for community discussion, Mozilla Team updates and consulatations](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/about-common-voice-readme-first/17218) and [matrix for community chats](https://app.element.io/#/room/#common-voice:mozilla.org).

If you would like to request a channel to be made available for your language please create an account on discourse or matrix and direct message heyhillary
